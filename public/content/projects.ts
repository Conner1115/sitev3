      `AmjadGPT is a chatbot trained to act like Amjad Masad, built with LangChain and Next.js.

This was my first time exploring Langchain.  It was a wild adventure from starting out to completing it.  I'm very proud of this project and how it turned out.`,
      `AmjadGPT uses \`text-davinci-003\` in the background and was fed the following data:

 - The [Replit docs](https://docs.replit.com), [Blog](https://blog.replit.com), and [Landing Page](https://replit.com)
 - The Replit Employee Organization Chart
 - Amjad's [personal blog](https://amasad.me), [AmA Repl](https://replit.com/@amasad/AmA?v=1), Podcasts, and [Tweets](https://twitter.com/amasad)
 - Replit's [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms) and [Community guidelines](https://welcome.moderation.repl.co)
 - Some random facts the AI should be aware of`,
      `I first built the AI part of this project with Python, but moved over to Langchain.js when it came out.
        \nPython was getting too ugly and unorganized for me, and hosting + using an external API outside of my Repl posed a security concern and a lower uptime guaruntee.`,
